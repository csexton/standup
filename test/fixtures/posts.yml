  user: quentin
  body: "Plan to throw one away, you will anyhow."
  
nine:
  user: quentin
  body: "The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time."

  body: "Learning is not compulsory. Neither is survival."
  
twelve:
  user: quentin
  body: "The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague."
  
thirteen:

fourteen:
  user: quentin
  body: "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity."
  
fithteen:
  user: quentin
  body: "Do not worry about your difficulties in mathematics. I can assure you that mine are still greater."
  
sixteen:
  user: quentin
  body: "Any code of your own that you haven't looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else."

twentyone:
  user: quentin
  body: "Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs. Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do."
